# OASIS API RELEASE HISTORY

This needs to be updated whenever we do anywork that will effect the OASIS API (even changes to properties, etc on OASIS.API.CORE objects that are used in the API, etc...
Then when we do a release, this file will be linked to the Swagger documentation. The file is also linked to the WIKI and GitHub Documentation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2.0.0 PREVIEW (14/04/22)

LOTS of improvements in all areas including performance, security, features, improved error handling/reporting as well as being upgraded to the latest .NET (v6), which itself comes with many performance/security improvements & new features.
This is built on top of a whole new massively improved OASIS Architecture with improved error handling/reporting, auto-fail over, auto-replication, auto-load balancing and so much more! ;-) 
Everything the OASIS API was intended to do is now implemented... 
This is the real deal and is the commerical production ready OASIS, and why is no longer a ALTHA prototype as the previous versions were, and is also why the version number jumps from 0 to 2. 1 included many internal builds and why the date between 0 and 2 is large.

TODO: Will attempt to list here more detail of what is in this release (a very long list! ;-) ).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2.0.1 PREVIEW (17/04/22)

Fixed a bug with the Authentication/Signup process where it previously allowed more than one avatar to be created with the same email address.

This was not really a bug but by deseign because when someone deletes a avatar it is soft deleted so it can be recovered later if needed. Then
 they can create a new avatar with the same email address, but in the end the logic and additional work was deemed not worth it at this stage,
 we may re-visit this later on. For now if an avatar is deleted it is still soft deleted, then the user has 3 options:
 
 (1) - They can create a new avatar with a new email address.
 (2) - They can contact support to get the avatar un-deleted and active again.
 (3) - They can contact support to get the avatar permaneltey deleted and then they can create a new avatar with their old email address.

 As part of this hotfix, the messages that are returned were improved to now who deleted the avatar and when. The next release will have the 3 options above added also to the message returned.

 This hotfix is what officially made the new OASIS 2.0 LIVE and usable and is no coincidence it was on EASTER SUNDAY! ;-) We did not plan to release
 on this day, but is interesting it was on Easter just like when our founder started reading Ready Player One book on Easter Sunday when he had no idea
 what the book was about (gunters hunting the golden egg, etc).

 This release also included miscellaneous fixes/improvements:

 https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/commit/0246c4f619111f425774edcc05e2dfaf459d5f06
  - Users can now login with their username, email or one of the public keys linked to their account.
  - Improved error handling/reporting in Auth/Signup.
  - Fixed a bug in AvatarManager where error messages were not properly formatted.
  - Improved error handling/reporting in JWTMiddleware for when a JWT Token expires/is invalid.
  - Changed Email to Username in AuthenticateRequest so need to use username instead of email for auth endpoint.
  - Added Username property to UpdateRequest so a avatars username can now also be updated/changed.
  - Refactored & improved Update, UpdateByEmail & UpdateByUsername methods in AvatarService so is now more efficient and generic calling into new private Update method.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2.0.2 PREVIEW (18/04/22)

Miscellaneous fixes/improvements including:

https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/commit/21f2f98650cb4262125dd83af039495e5de51af3
 - Can now upload & retreive an avatar image using their username & email as well as their id.
 - When an avatar image is retrived it now also shows the avatars username & email address in addition to their id.
 - Updated GetAvatarUmaJsonById, GetAvatarUmaJsonByUsername & GetAvatarUmaJsonByEmail methods so more detailed error messages are now returned.
 - When you now update an avatar it also syncs and updates AvatarDetail with the new username/email if they were changed in Avatar.
 - Updated Swagger index page to now include correct link to Postman JSON file as well as adding links to the DEV, STAGING & LIVE Enviroment JSON files.
 - Fixed a bug in MongoDBOASIS Provider where the email and username were not being mapped in ConvertMongoEntityToOASISAvatarDetail & ConvertOASISAvatarDetailToMongoEntity methods.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2.1 (05/05/22)

First official version of the production ready to use OASIS API! :)

Many improvements:<br>
https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/commit/42a43cc3c788cd6333bd937a997d443da3b195ed
- Added a new StackTraces property to the OASISResult wrapper.
- Detailed messages are now added to the new StackTraces property of OASISResult rather than being appended to the InnerMessages property in HandleWarning method in ErrorHandling helper,
- Fixed a bug in Authtenticate/AuthenticateAsync methods for logging in with a public key linked to an avatar in AvataManager.
- Also improved Authtenticate/AuthenticateAsync methods by making more generic and efficient using the new ProcessAvatarLogin method in AvataManager.
- Created a new ProcessAvatarLogin method in AvataManager.
- All methods in AvatarManager upgraded to now also pass in their detailedMessages into HandleError/HandleWarning methods.
- Fixed a bug in all methods in AvatarManager where the response from load/save methods on an OASIS Provider were not being handled properly.
- Added AutoMapper to OASIS.API.Core to be used in UpdateAvatarDetailAsync method.
- Added Automapper config to UpdateAvatarDetailAsync method.
- Upgraded AutoMapper to v11 in OASIS.API.ONode.WebAPI project so matches the version added to OASIS.API.Core.

https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/commit/cf1cf1b0ab282acabf7af64d2d50df530962c492
- Removed where clause restriction on OASISResultCollectionToCollection helper so can be used for mapping any objects and not just holons.
- Improved Security: Removed LoadAvatar/LoadAvatarAsync method overloads that take a username and password as params (only the overloads that take username are currently used because the password is decrypted in AvatarManager and checked there so is more secure) from IOASISStorageProvider interface.
- Related to above removed LoadAvatar/LoadAvatarAsync method overloads that take a username and password as params from AvatarManager.
- Releated to above removed LoadAvatar/LoadAvatarAsync method overloads that take a username and password as params from OASISStorageProviderBase.
- Releated to above removed LoadAvatar/LoadAvatarAsync method overloads that take a username and password as params from ActivityPubOASIS, BlockStackOASIS, ChainLinkOASIS, CosmosBlockChainOASIS, ElrondOASISOASIS, EOSIOOASIS, EthereumOASIS, HashgraphOASIS, HoloOASISBase, IPFSOASIS, MongoDBOASIS, Neo4jOASIS, PLANOASIS, ScuttlebuttOASIS, SolanaOASIS, SOLIDOASIS, TelosOASIS, ThreeFoldOASIS & TRONOASIS providers.
- UpdateAvatarDetail method in AvatarController now only ta
- Finished implementing UpdateAvatarDetailAsync methods in AvatarManager. It curretly only allows users to update the base properties, not the nested child objects (this functionality will be added soon...). It also syncs and updates the releated Avatar object if the username or email is changed because these are shared between the objects.
- Related to above finished implementing UpdateAvatarDetailByUsernameAsync & UpdateAvatarDetailByEmailAsync methods in AvatarManager.
- Upgraded DeleteAvatarAsync/DeleteAvatarByUsernameAsync/DeleteAvatarByUsername/DeleteAvatarByEmailAsync/DeleteAvatarByEmail methods in AvatarManager so that it now checks if the avatar has already been deleted and if it has it will inform the user that it has already been deleted and the date and by which avatar id.
- Implemented DeleteAvatar method in AvatarManager.
- Fixed bugs in LoadAvatarForProvider & LoadAvatarForProviderAsync methods in AvatarManager where the result was not being set correctly.
- Added UpdateAvatarDetailByEmail method to AvatarController.
- Added UpdateAvatarDetailByEmail & UpdateAvatarDetailByUsername methods to AvatarController.
- Updated the rest of the AvatarRepository methods to now return OASISResult as per the standard OASIS standards so better reporting/error handling info can be passed back to AvatarManager, etc. Now just need to do the same for HolonRepository and then MongoDBOASIS provider is finally finished and will be an example and best practice of how to implement a OASIS Provider so this is important work to finish before more devs get involved and build more...
- Also upgraded the Delete/DeleteAsync method overloads in AvatarRepository in MongoDBOASIS so they now use a transaction for deleting the avatar and then also delete the corresponding avatarDetail, if either fail it will roll back the transaction so they are done as a ATOMIC operation, so they will always match each other, one cannot exist without the other one. Also improved error handling, etc.

https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/commit/52f37e959440d17e8bf25e8b4e74258db77f23ff

- Improved OASIS Arcitecture generally.

https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/commit/b2172f455b3869e2dc70b854b8aa68cde83bec04 <br>
Fixed a bug in GetAllProviderPrivateKeysForAvatarById method in KeyManager where the keys were not null checked.

https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/commit/8c93ea5398160aa4a273b2da1f10865c5581552f
- Improved OASIS Error Handling/Reporting.
- Added new HandleError and HandleWarning overloads to ErrorHandling helper that take an optional innerResult param so its InnerMessages, WarningCount etc can be added to the main OASISResult.
- HolonBase constructors no longer automatically create a new id (it needs to be created manually by the caller).
- Added WalletId property to IProviderWallet because the base Id property on HolonBase was not being serialaized.
- Fixed a bug in VerifyEmail method in AvataManager as a side effect from the latest work done in AvatarManager (new optional loadPrivateKeys param being added).
- Removed all private key caches to make it even more secure so private keys are never stored in memory and are only loaded from local storage and decrypted and sent to client per request to remove attack surface area.
- LinkProviderPublicKeyToAvatarById, LinkProviderPublicKeyToAvatarByUsername & LinkProviderPublicKeyToAvatarByEmail methods in KeyManager now load private keys when loading the avatar so when it saves the wallet back to local storage the private keys are not blanked out.
- LinkProviderPublicKeyToAvatar method in KeyManager now sets WalletId, AvatarId, CreatedByAvatarId & CreatedDate properties on new wallets and sets ModifiedByAvatarId and ModifiedDate on existing wallets.
- Fixed a bug in LinkProviderPublicKeyToAvatar method in KeyManager where the avatar was being saved before the local storage wallets (so the private keys were blanked out before they could be saved). It now saves to local storage first.
- LinkProviderPrivateKeyToAvatar method in KeyManager has multiple bugs fixed including checking if a key has already been linked, saving the local storage wallets before saving the avatar, improved error handling, setting WalletId, AvatarId, CreatedByAvatarId & CreatedDate for new wallets and setting ModifiedByAvatarId & ModifiedDate for exisitng wallets.
- Completley re-wrote GetProviderPrivateKeysForAvatarById & GetProviderPrivateKeysForAvatarByUsername methods in KeyManager to work with the new local storage wallets.
- Removed GetAvatarIdForProviderPrivateKey, GetAvatarUsernameForProviderPrivateKey, GetAvatarEmailForProviderPrivateKey & GetAvatarForProviderPrivateKey methods in KeyManager since would be extra work, potential security issue and not sure if there would be a good use case for them?
- Fixed a bug in GetAllProviderPrivateKeysForAvatarById & GetAllProviderPrivateKeysForAvatarByUsername methods in KeyManager.
- Fixed bugs in LoadProviderWalletsForAvatarByUsernameAsync, LoadProviderWalletsForAvatarByUsername, LoadProviderWalletsForAvatarByEmailAsync, LoadProviderWalletsForAvatarByEmail, LoadProviderWalletsForAvatarByUsername, LoadProviderWalletsForAvatarByUsernameAsync,  LoadProviderWalletsForAvatarByEmail, LoadProviderWalletsForAvatarByEmailAsync, SaveProviderWalletsForAvatarByUsername, SaveProviderWalletsForAvatarByUsernameAsync, SaveProviderWalletsForAvatarByEmail, SaveProviderWalletsForAvatarByEmailAsync, SaveProviderWalletsForAvatarByUsername, SaveProviderWalletsForAvatarByUsernameAsync, SaveProviderWalletsForAvatarByEmail, SaveProviderWalletsForAvatarByEmailAsync & GetWalletThatPublicKeyBelongsTo methods where the detailed error message was not being bubbled up correctly.
- Rewrote & improved LoadProviderWalletsForAvatarById, LoadProviderWalletsForAvatarByIdAsync, SaveProviderWalletsForAvatarById & SaveProviderWalletsForAvatarByIdAsync methods in WalletManager.
- Added WalletId to ProviderWallet object.
- Removed GetAvatarIdForProviderPrivateKey, GetAvatarUsernameForProviderPrivateKey &  GetAvatarForProviderPrivateKey methods from KeysController.
- Fixed a bug in Update, UpdateByEmail & UpdateByUsername methods in AvatarService from side-effect of improvements to AvatarManager (new loadPrivateKeys param).
- Fixed a bug in  LoadProviderWalletsForAvatarById & LoadProviderWalletsForAvatarByIdAsync methods in LocalFileOASIS Provider where it was not checking if the wallet file exists.
- Fixed a bug in  SaveProviderWalletsForAvatarById & SaveProviderWalletsForAvatarByIdAsync methods where it was not serializing the wallets correctly (missing WalletId).

- Added new LocalFileOASIS enum type to ProviderType and moved None, All & Default to the top.
- Save & SaveAsync methods on Avatar/IAvatar now take a optional providerType param.
- Added SendTrasaction & SendTrasactionAsync methods to IOASISBlockchainStorageProvider interface that blockchain OASIS Providers need to implmenet.
- Added new IOASISLocalStorageProvider interface that contains LoadProviderWallets, LoadProviderWalletsAsync, SaveProviderWallets & SaveProviderWalletsAsync methods that a Local Storage OASIS Provider need to implement such as HoloOASIS, SQLLiteDBOASIS & LocalFileOASIS. There will be more to come...
- Added SendNFT & SendNFTAsync methods to IOASISNFTProvider interface.
- Added Import, ExportAllDataForAvatarById, ExportAllDataForAvatarByUsername, ExportAllDataForAvatarByEmail & ExportAll methods to IOASISStorageProvider interface.
- Added SendTransaction, SendTransactionAsync, SendNFT & SendNFTAsync methods to IOASISWallet & IProviderWallet interfaces & OASISWallet & ProviderWallet objects.
- Added new Instance properties to all OASISManagers such as AvatarManager, HolonManager, KeyManager, WalletManager & SearchManager allowing static instances to be used instead of having to create new instances (singleton pattern best practice).
- Moved OASISDNA & OASISDNAPath from OASISStorageProviderBase to OASISProvider abstract class because these are relevant to all providers, not just storage providers.
- Added Import, ExportAllDataForAvatarById, ExportAllDataForAvatarByUsername, ExportAllDataForAvatarByEmail & ExportAll methods to OASISStorageProviderBase.
- Added new LocalFileOASIS setting to OASISDNA.

- Added new LocalFileOASIS Provider which will serialize the avatar & holon data objects to a JSON file. Currently is serializes the Provider Wallets containing the private keys (encrypted) but will add additional encryption soon including quantum level encryption.
- Removed ProviderPrivateKey, ProviderPublicKey, ProviderUsername & ProviderWalletAddress properties from the AvatarDetail entity in MongoDBOASIS Provider.
- Added new LocalFileOASIS Provider to OASISBootLoader and fixed some other minor bugs.


 https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/commit/408026b7be87d2b00d37abb57d9db07ab0113183
- Fixed a bug in LoadAvatarForProviderAsync & LoadAvatarByEmailForProviderAsync methods where it now checks if the provider is a StorageLocalAndNetwork category as well as a StorageLocal category before loading the provider wallets.

- Many other enhancements to the OASIS Engine/OASIS API REST Web API such as the ability to now set whether to autoReplicate, autoFailOver, autoReplicate, providers to auto replication to, providers to auto load balance to and providers to auto fail over to per API call per avatar. This means each API call per avatar can be fully customised the avatar/user is in FULL control of their data, where it is stored and how and when and allows full control over the behaviour of how to handle auto-failover, load balancing and auto replication. This makes the OASIS API many more times powerful than it already was! :)
It also now also shows the current status of the OASIS Engine in every response you get from every API call (such as whether auto-failvover, auto-loadbalance and auto-replication are enabled or not, the current OASIS version, standard HTTP best practice info and more and even allows additional detailed stats to be enabled/disabled such as which providers are auto-replicating, are in auto-fail over and auto-load balance lists.
So as you can see this was a massive upgrade to the OASIS Engine/Architecture as well as the OASIS API.

## 2.3.0 (22/07/22)

- Improvements & upgrades to the Data API.
- Finished upgrading the OASISEngine so now EVERY API call can fully customise the OASIS Engine for that call such as whether auto-load balance, auto-fail over, auto-replication is enabled, which providers to use for auto-replication, auto-load balance & auto-failover, whether to show the auto-replication, auto-load balance & auto-failover lists in the response returned & whether to wait for auto-replication result. This allows for greating power and flexability so the OASIS Engine behaviour can be customised by api call per avatar.
- Improved OASIS Arcitecture generally.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 3.0.0 (09/09/23)

A brief summary of the massive amount of work that has gone into this release is detailed below, this does not include everything, just a few highlights, please see the full commit history further down for the full list.

- Added 2 new methods to the Avatar API: get-all-avatar-names and get-all-avatar-names-grouped-by-name that both have 2 params allowing you to specify whether to also include usernames and id's (if both are false it will only return their full name). Full name is made up of FirstName and LastName fields and both are NOT unique because people share the same first and last names, the username and email fields ARE unique however.
- Related to above, new accounts/avatars now need to specify a unique username when creating a avatar. Previous versions only needed an email, which was then used as the default username (which they could then change later). The issue with this was that the new Avatar API methods above return their username so would expose user's private email addresses! So this has now been fixed. Old accounts will have the username changed to their fullname (if there are more than one sharing this name then it will add a 1,2,3 etc to the end to make it unique), they can then login and change it to whatever they like (but it needs to be unique).
- Updated the email templates used in the Avatar API, which are in turn used for methods such as register, authenticate, verify-email etc.
- Implemented new LevelManager which dynamically calculates the avatar's level based on their karma score (previously it was hard-coded and only supported upto level 10! It now supports infinite levels).
- As part of the above, Karma is now a long rather than an int supporting much higer avatar levels. The maximum karma score is now 9,223,372,036,854,775,807, we don't even think Budaha himself could have achived this! ;-)
- Avatar has new FullNameWithTitle property.
- Renamed Password to NewPassword and ConfirmPassword to ConfirmNewPassword for reset-password Avatar API method.
- Fixed a bug in reset-password Avatar API method where the message response was being set in the Result property instead of the Message one.
- Various fixes/improvements to the Avatar API.
- Added new AzureCosmosDBOASIS OASIS Provider adding support for the Azure Cosmos DB Cloud service from Microsoft, allowing people to import/export their cloud data to the OASIS as well as store their OASIS Avatar & data to the cloud if they wish (could be used as a backup or redundancy in case their local copies get lost or corrupted etc).
- Neo4j OASIS Provider has been re-written from scratch with many improvements/fixes etc.
- HoloOSIS Provider has also been re-written from scatch with many improvements/fixes to work with the latest HoloNET (world's first .NET/Unity client for Holochain). This is a pre-release and so is still a WIP so it is not quite ready to be used yet, but will be in a future version soon...
- New NFT API - This allows mass interoperability between NFT's across all chains and even web2 as well as IPFS, Holochain and more! It introduces a new global generic NFT Standard (The OASISNFT) as well as the OASISGeoSpatialNFT standard. It also includes the new cross-chain OASIS Geo-NFT API and many other unique world first's that are being implemented in our AR Geo-location game Our World.
- New OLAND NFT API - Related to above, it also includes a new OLAND NFT API allowing people to purchase virtual land in Our World and The OASIS. This is built on top of the new NFT API.
- As part of above, added new INFTWalletTransaction interface.
- Added a new MemoText property to IWalletTransaction interface.
- All SendTraction and SendTractionAsync methods in IOASISBlockchainStorageProvider interface in OASIS.Core now return OASISResult<TransactionRespone> instead of OASISResult<bool>.
- Added HostURI, EOSAccountName, EOSChainId & EOSAccountPk properties to EOSIOOASIS Provider.
- Re-wrote and improved ActivateProviderAsync, ActivateProvider, DeActivateProviderAsync & DeActivateProvider methods in EOSIOOASIS Provider.
- Implemented new async versions for ActivateProvider and DeActivateProvider so these sometimes time intensive operations can now be done asyncally so can be done in the background and not block/slow down the OASIS Arcitecture (follows best practices).
- Various other older core OASIS Architecture methods have also been upgraded to async versions giving yet further performance and stability improvements.
- Added ActivateProviderAsync & DeActivateProviderAsync methods to BlockStackOASIS, ChainlinkOASIS, CosmosBlockchainOASIS, AzureCosmosDBOASIS, ElrondOASIS, EOSIOOASIS, EthereumOASIS, HashgraphOASIS, PLANOASIS, ScuttlebuttOASIS, SOLIDOASIS, ThreeFoldOASIS & TRONOASIS providers.
- Improved and upgraded the OASIS Interfaces that the various OASIS Providers use such as IOASISStorageProvider, IOASISBlockchainStorageProvider, IOASISDBStorageProvider, IOASISLocalStorageProvider, IOASISNETProvider, IOASISNFTProvider, IOASISProvider etc. 
- Releated to above all methods in the core IOASISStorageProvider interface now have additional async versions of their methods giving yet further performance/stability improvements.
- Releated to above upgraded all of the OASIS Providers to use the new interface versions.
- Added ActivateProviderAsync & DeActivateProviderAsync methods to BlockStackOASIS, ChainlinkOASIS, CosmosBlockchainOASIS, AzureCosmosDBOASIS, ElrondOASIS, EOSIOOASIS, EthereumOASIS, HashgraphOASIS, PLANOASIS, ScuttlebuttOASIS, SOLIDOASIS, ThreeFoldOASIS & TRONOASIS providers.
- Added HostURI, ChainPrivateKey, ChainId & ContractAddress properties to EthereumOASIS Provider.
- Refactored EthereumOASIS Provider so setup/init code is now done in the ActivateProviderAsync & ActivateProvider methods rather than the constructor giving further performance/stability improvements.
- Added Search, SearchAsync, Import, ImportAsync, ExportAllDataForAvatarByIdAsync, ExportAllDataForAvatarById, ExportAllDataForAvatarByUsername, ExportAllDataForAvatarByUsernameAsync, ExportAllDataForAvatarByEmail, ExportAllDataForAvatarByEmailAsync, ExportAll & ExportAllAsync methods to IPFSOASIS, LocalFileOASIS, MongoDBOASIS, Neo4jOASIS, SolanaOASIS & SQLLiteDBOASIS providers.
- Added new overloads to SendTransactionById method in IOASISBlockchainStorageProvider interface that takes a token in OASIS.API.Core.
- Renamed LoadAvatarForProviderKeyAsync to LoadAvatarByProviderKeyAsync and LoadAvatarForProviderKey method to LoadAvatarByProviderKey in IOASISStorageProvider interface and OASISStorageProviderBase in OASIS.API.Core.
- Updated ActivityPubOASIS, AzureCosmosDBOASIS, BlockStackOASIS, ChainLinkOASIS, CosmosBlockchainOASIS, ElrondOASIS, HashgraphOASIS, HoloOASIS, IPFSOASIS, LocalFileOASIS, MongoDBOASIS, Neo4jOASIS, PLANOASIS, ScuttlebuttOASIS, SolanaOASIS, SOLIDOASIS, EOSOASIS, EthereumOASIS, SQLLiteDBOASIS, TelosOASIS, ThreeFoldOASIS & TRONOASOS providers to reflect the above changes as well as other improvements, better layout, etc.
- Added new OASIS Provider Template making it easier for devs to jump in and build new OASIS Providers. https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/tree/master/NextGenSoftware.OASIS.API.Providers.ProviderNameOASIS and https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/wiki/OASIS-Provider-Template.
- Related to above the Provider Development section on our WIKI has also been updated: https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/wiki/Provider-Development.
- Created and released new OASIS Runtime: https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/releases/tag/OASIS-Runtime-v2.3.1. This allows the OASIS Runtime to be embedded and integrated directly into any c# project (app, game, website, service etc) and so can also work offline unlike the REST API Service.
- Related to above created new [NextGenSoftware.OASIS.API.Native.EndPoint](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NextGenSoftware.OASIS.API.Native.Integrated.EndPoint) NuGet Package (users OASIS Runtime under the hood just like the REST API Service does) to be used to integrate the OASIS API direcly in your app bypassing the existing REST API. Can be used for offline/poor conncection use cases, etc. This version will also of of course be faster than the REST API. This version also contains some functionality not currently implemented in the REST API.
- Improved the OASIS Architecture generally.
- Upgraded OASIS API/OASIS Architecture and all OASIS Providers to the latest and fastest version (v7) of .NET yet! Giving yet more performance/stability improvements & making it even more secure!
- Various stability/performance improvments.
- Improved error handling/reporting.
- Various under the hood improvements/bug fixes.

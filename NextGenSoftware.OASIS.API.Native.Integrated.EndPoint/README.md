# NextGen Software WEB4 OASIS API Integrated EndPoint (Native)

The OASIS API Integrated EndPoint. To be used to integrate the OASIS API directly into target applications (including Unity) instead of using the existing REST API. Can be used for offline/poor conncection use cases, etc. This version will also of of course be faster than the REST API. This version also contains some functionality not currently implemented in the REST API.

Initial Release targeting OASIS API v2.3.1 (Current LIVE REST version): \
https://api.oasisplatform.world

Both this package and the [OASIS API REST Service](https://api.oasisplatform.world) use the [OASIS Runtime v2.3.1](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/releases/tag/OASIS-Runtime-v2.3.1).

This package wraps around the OASIS Runtime providing an entry-point into the API. The OASIS Runtime is not designed to be used directly on its own but you can be if you wish. It is recommended you use either the [OASIS API REST Service](https://api.oasisplatform.world) or this package.
